# Data Description
These data files are the test problems used in the paper:
Chang, T.-J., Meade, N., Beasley, J.E. and Sharaiha, Y.M., 
"Heuristics for cardinality constrained portfolio optimisation" 
Comp. & Opns. Res. 27 (2000) 1271-1302. These data correspond to weekly prices from
March 1992 to September 1997 and they come from the indices: Hang Seng in Hong
Kong, DAX 100 in Germany, FTSE 100 in UK, S&P 100 in USA and Nikkei 225 in
Japan. The number N of different assets considered for each one of the test problems
is 31, 85, 89, 98 and 225, respectively.

## Each index:
* for each asset i (i=1,...,N):
    * mean return, standard deviation of return
* for all possible pairs of assets:
    * i, j, correlation between asset i and asset j
