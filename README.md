# Portfolio Optimization Problem Definition
### [Research Paper](https://github.com/taylankabbani/METAHEURISTIC-APPROACH-FOR-POP/blob/master/Description/Progress_Repo.pdf)
 Tabu Search and TokenRing Search is being used in order to solve the Portfolio Optimization Problem. The seminal mean-variance model of Markowitz is being considered with the addition of cardinality and quantity constraints to better capture the dynamics of the trading procedure, the model becomes NP-hard problem which can not be solved using an exact method. The combination of three different neighborhood relations is being explored with Tabu Search. In addition, a new constructive method for the initial solution is proposed. Finally, I show how the proposed techniques perform on public benchmarks.
# In this Study
Specific constraints will be introduced to the basic
*Markowitz* model in order to make it more adherent to the real world
trading mechanisms. The addition of these constraint will turn the model
from Quadratic Programming (QP) problem to a Mixed Integer Quadratic
Programming (MIQP) problem, which is a NP-Hard problem that can be
optimally solved using *Metaheuristic* approaches.  
*The Constrained Multi-Objective Portfolio Selection* will be applied on
new problem instances (Istanbul Stock exchange), and will be optimally
solved using a Metaheuristics approach, (**Tabu Search**).
